### Content

#### Introduction

##### Part 1 (200 words)

*   Thesis statement & Purpose & goal
*   Article structure description (outline)

##### Part 2 (350~500 words)

*   Introduction to AI developments
    *   Definition of AI
    *   History of AI development
    *   Recent cutting-edge technology of AI
*   Introduction to Turing test
    *   Definition of Turing test

#### Body (800 words)


*   Is the Turing test enough?

    *   A general statement of the Turing test
    *   Strengths & Weaknesses
    *   Different methods of testing artificial systems based on Turing test

        *   The Cognitive Decathlon
        *   The staged developmental test 
        *   The intelligence tests for robots
        *   The universal anytime intelligence tests
*   Is AI testing really necessary?

    *   AI test can't test intelligence, only test the resemblance between intelligent system and human.
    *   AI testing provides a goal for AI development.
    *   The progress of AI testing is also the improvement of human needs.
*   Conclusion

    *   Although the Turing test is important, it does not meet today's needs.
    *   A complete AI test can't be completed in the first stage, but it provides direction for the future AI trend and lays the foundation for more systematic and advanced testing.
