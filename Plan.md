## Extended-Writing Plan

### Title

"**Describe**
some recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and **evaluate** some
of the ways of testing its reliability."

### Content

#### Introduction(150 words)

*   General background
    *   Introduction of AI
        *   Definition of AI[1,2,3]
    *   Introduction of AI test system
        *   The definition of AI test system[4]
        *   The necessity of AI system testing[5]

*   Thesis statement & Purpose
*   Article structure description (outline)

#### Body (1200~1500 words)

*   The recent developments in AI
    *   Supervised Learning:  AI learns to manipulate tools using Task-Oriented Grasping Network[6]
    *   Deep Learning: Tesla Autopilot using Convolutional Neural Network[9]
*   AI test systems
    *   Different AI test systems
        *   Turing Test[4]: but only focus on text, not comprehensive
        *   Total Turing Test[7]
        *   Cognitive Decathlon Test[8]
    *   Evaluation of AI reliability


*   Conclusion

    *   Although the Turing test is important, it does not meet today's needs.
    *   A complete AI test can't be completed in the first stage yet, but it provides direction for the future AI trend and lays the foundation for more systematic and advanced testing.
